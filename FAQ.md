# Frequently Asked Question

## Security

### Random source:

- Does the hardware wallet have an entropy source?
  * Yes, the `True` random number generator peripheral implemented on wallet
    microcontrollers is based on an analog circuit. This circuit generates a 
    continuous analog noise that will be used by the RNG processing in order to 
    produce a 32-bit random number. To verify the true randomness of the numbers 
    generated a verification is performed based on the
    National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Statistical Test Suite (STS) 
    SP 800-22rev1a (April 2010).
- Does the hardware wallet get entropy from the host machine?
  * Yes, an external random 32 bytes  buffer is used to increase internal entropy
    when performing cryptographically sensitive operations e.g. mnemonic generation
- How does the hardware wallet get entropy?
  * The hardware wallet generates internal entropy from a peripheral device. This value is
    [salted with several sources](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/73588/does-too-long-a-salt-reduce-the-security-of-a-stored-password-hash)
    so as to make unfeasible some kinds of dictionary and lookup attacks (e.g. [rainbow tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table) ).
    The salt is chosen in such a way that no two devices can generate the same value in (at least) the time frame of a human lifetime.
    Such values [might not be particularly random](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/16117/in-hashing-does-it-matter-how-random-a-salt-is).
    Internal entropy is eventually combined with an external entropy received from the user host device.
