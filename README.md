## Overview

This folder provides a firmware implementing skycoin features, and tools to test it.

The firmware itself is under [tiny-firmware](https://github.com/skycoin/hardware-wallet/tree/master/tiny-firmware) folder.
The firmware had been copied and modified from [this repository](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-mcu).

The [skycoin-api](https://github.com/skycoin/hardware-wallet/tree/master/skycoin-api) folder contains the definition of the functions implementing the skycoin features.

The [skycoin-hw-cli](https://github.com/skycoin/hardware-wallet-go/releases) defines golang functions that communicate with the firmware.

There is also a [javascript API](https://github.com/skycoin/hardware-wallet-js/).

Follow up [the wiki](https://github.com/skycoin/hardware-wallet/wiki/Hardware-wallet-project-advancement) to keep track of project advancement.

## FAQ

[Frequently Asked Question](FAQ.md)

## Install tools

Follow the instructions written on [tiny-firware/README.md](https://github.com/skycoin/hardware-wallet/blob/master/tiny-firmware/README.md)

## Build instructions:

### Build and run emulator

Update submodules:

```
git submodule update --init --recursive

make clean && make run-emulator
```

In case of needing special compiler flags for the SDL library it is possible to provide them in `SDL_CFLAGS` variable. For instance , if SDL was installed with brew on Mac OS X then the following command execution would force searching for header files at the right location.

```
make clean && make run-emulator SDL_CFLAGS=-I$(brew --prefix sdl2)/include/SDL2
```

However for the default `brew` installation in practice this should not be needed since the value of `SDL_CFLAGS` defaults to `$(shell sdl2-config --cflags | sed 's/-D_THREAD_SAFE//g')`.

### Build a bootloader

```
make bootloader # Your firmware is bootloader-no-memory-protect.bin
```

### Build a bootloader with memory protection enabled

Careful if you flash and run that bootloader on the device it will activate a memory protection that will close access to flash memory.

You won't be able to flash your device with an st-link again.

```
make bootloader-mem-protect # Your firmware is bootloader-memory-protected.bin
```

### Build a firmware

```
make firmware  # Your firmware is tiny-firmware/skycoin.bin
```

### Sign firmware

```
make sign # Your firmware is tiny-firmware/skycoin.bin
```

### Combine bootloader and firmware

```
make full-firmware # this will create a full-firmware-no-mem-protect.bin file
```

### Combine a memory protected bootloader and firmware

Careful if you flash and run that bootloader on the device it will activate a memory protection that will close access to flash memory.

You won't be able to flash your device with an st-link again.

```
make full-firmware-mem-protect # this will create a full-firmware-memory-protected.bin file 
```

## Development guidelines

Code added in this repository should comply to development guidelines documented in [Skycoin wiki](https://github.com/skycoin/skycoin/wiki).

The project has two branches: `master` and `develop`.

- `develop` is the default branch and will always have the latest code.
- `master` will always be equal to the current stable release on the website, and should correspond with the latest release tag.

### Versioning policies

#### Firmware version scheme

The firmware defines a contract enforced upon all client libraries communicating with SkyWallet hardware devices. Firmware version expresses implemented contract version using a scheme based on [semantic versioning](http://semver.org). Individual components should be interpreted as follows :

- **Major version number** should be increased only if a new release introduces changes that are not backwards-compatible with respect to previous version
- **Minor version number** should be increased for releases adding incremental backwards-compatible changes to the firmware contract
- **Patch version number** should be increased for bug fix releases and similar changes keeping firmware contract unchanged

#### Bootloader version scheme

Bootloader versioning is independent and follows [semantic versioning](http://semver.org) rules.

- **Major version number** indicates major changes in bootloader code
- **Minor version number** is used for progressive backwards-compatible changes
- **Patch version number** increased for bug fix releases

#### Versioning combined binary builds

The project releases production-ready binaries combining firmware and bootloader. A custom version scheme is used based on the rules that follow

- **Bootloader version**: Consecutive bootloader version identifier
- **Firmware version**: Consecutive firmware version identifier
- **SoC identifier**: for the MCU model and combination of peripherals considered for building the specific combined binary release. A value of `0` should be reserved to developer's local environment
- **Country Exit Code**: to cope with i18n and locale specific features. At present only a value of `1` is supported for American English (i.e. `en_US`).

Version identifiers are strings including, in the same order, the numbers mentioned above separated by dots.

#### Versioning libraries

In order to identify at first sight the features supported by a particular release of a client library, its major and minor version numbers should match the corresponding values of the version of the firmware they were built (tested) for. It is expected that the aforementioned library will be able to communicate to any firmware, as long as both versions (client and firmware) have the same major version number and firmware minor number is greater than the one of the library.

### Running tests

The project includes a test suite. In order to run it just execute the following command

```
make test
```

### Validate the TRNG

To be able to validate the device trng you need to install the following tools:

- `dieharder` (A testing and benchmarking tool for random number generators)
- `ent` (pseudorandom number sequence test)
- `rng-tools` (Check the randomness of data using FIPS 140-2 tests)

For example, in a debian based system you can run `apt install dieharder ent rng-tools`

In order to make the validation you need to build the firmware with `ENABLE_GETENTROPY` flag set o `1` and maybe you want to dissable button confirmation by seeting `DISABLE_GETENTROPY_CONFIRM` to `1`, the following is an example:

```bash
make clean
make firmware ENABLE_GETENTROPY=1 DISABLE_GETENTROPY_CONFIRM=1
```

After this , connect a Skywallet device and just run the following command:

```
make check-trng
```

After running the tools [some files](#Files-description) are generated and need to be analyzed by a human. Some of they are easy(because have an `Assessment` column) at a first look like for example:

But in general a bit of research should be done looking at the files content. This feature come mainly from https://github.com/trezor/rng-test, so any advice from this repo is good as well

### Releases

#### Skycoin firmware releases

The skycoin firmware is composed of two parts: the [bootloader](https://github.com/skycoin/hardware-wallet/tree/master/tiny-firmware/bootloader) and the [firmware](https://github.com/skycoin/hardware-wallet/tree/master/tiny-firmware/firmware).

When plugging the device in, the bootloader runs first. Its only purpose it to check firmware's validity using Skycoin signature.

The firmware is expected to have a header with proper MAGIC number and three signature slots. 

If the firmware does not have a valid signature in its header it is considered "not official". A warning will be displayed but the user can still skip it and use it anyway.

The "unofficial firmware warning", means that the firmware was not signed by Skycoin Foundation. 

Skycoin firmware is open source and it is easy to fork or copy official repository and create concurrent firmware for the device. Skycoin Foundation however will not put its signature on it.

The Skycoin hardware will be shipped with an immutable bootloader written in a protected memory that is impossible to re-write.

The firmware however can evolve over time and some solutions were developed to update an existing firmware (see [skycoin-hw-cli](https://github.com/skycoin/hardware-wallet-go/releases)).

##### Full-Firmware and bootloader folder

The [full-firmware](https://github.com/skycoin/hardware-wallet/tree/master/tiny-firmware/full-firmware) and [bootloader](https://github.com/skycoin/hardware-wallet/tree/master/tiny-firmware/bootloader) folders are here for development purpose. They are meant to be [flashed with st-link](https://github.com/skycoin/hardware-wallet/blob/master/tiny-firmware/README.md#3-how-to-burn-the-firmware-in-the-device) on a STM32 device in which the memory protection was not enabled yet.

You can check [here](https://github.com/skycoin/hardware-wallet/blob/master/tiny-firmware/README.md#3-how-to-burn-the-firmware-in-the-device) for instructions about how to burn a full firmware on a device.

##### Firmware folder

If you are a user of the skycoin electronic wallet and want to update your firmware. You can pick-up [official and tested releases](https://github.com/skycoin/hardware-wallet/releases).

To update firmware the device must be in "bootloader mode". Press both buttons, unplug your device and plug it back in. Then you can use [skycoin-cli](https://github.com/skycoin/hardware-wallet/releases) `firmwareUpdate` message to update the firmware.

#### Update the version

0. If the `master` branch has commits that are not in `develop` (e.g. due to a hotfix applied to `master`), merge `master` into `develop` (and fix any build or test failures)
0. Switch to a new release branch named `release-X.Y.Z` for preparing the release.
0. Update `tiny-firmware/VERSION` and `tiny-firmware/bootloader/VERSION` with corresponding version numbers
0. Run `make build` to make sure that the code base is up to date
0. Update `CHANGELOG.md`: move the "unreleased" changes to the version and add the date.
0. Follow the steps in [pre-release testing](#pre-release-testing)
0. Make a PR merging the release branch into `master`
0. Review the PR and merge it
0. Tag the `master` branch with the version number. Version tags start with `v`, e.g. `v0.20.0`. Sign the tag. If you have your GPG key in github, creating a release on the Github website will automatically tag the release. It can be tagged from the command line with `git tag -as v0.20.0 $COMMIT_ID`, but Github will not recognize it as a "release".
0. Tag the changeset of the `protob` submodule checkout with the same version number as above.
0. Release builds are created and uploaded by travis. To do it manually, checkout the master branch and follow the [create release builds instructions](#creating-release-builds).
0. Checkout `develop` branch and bump `tiny-firmware/VERSION` and `tiny-firmware/bootloader/VERSION` to next [`dev` version number](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/#developmental-releases).

#### Pre-release testing

Once the candidate release build artifacts have been downloaded it is necessary to check once again that they behave according to specifications. The followinfg steps are aimed at ensuring this is the case. Execute 

0. Flash the device with latest versions of bootloader and firmware
0. Ensure you have a recent version of Skycoin desktop software in one of the following ways
  - build desktop wallet from source either following instructions [from master branch](https://github.com/skycoin/skycoin/blob/master/electron/README.md) or [from develop branch](https://github.com/skycoin/skycoin/blob/master/electron/README.md)
  - download Skycoin wallet from [official downloads page](https://www.skycoin.net/downloads/)
0. Open desktop wallet
0. Recover a test wallet with nonzero balance from seed to confirm wallet loading works
0. Send coins to another wallet to confirm spending works
0. Check that transferred amounts reported in transaction history are correct
0. Add a PIN to the hardware wallet 
0. Use the same recovery seed of the wallet configured in the Skywallet device and to load a wallet directly in desktop wallet
0. Send coins to another wallet again
0. Check transaction history once again
0. Wipe the wallet
0. Set up the hardware wallet with a random seed and write down the first address
0. Create a seed backup
0. Wipe the wallet and restore the seed. Check if the first address is equal to the one previously written
0. Repeat steps from the top but using combined bootloader + firmware image to flash the hardware wallet device.

#### Creating release builds

The following instruction creates a full firmware with:
* firmware version: 1.1.0
* bootloader version: 1.2.0

```bash
make combined-release-mem-protect VERSION_FIRMWARE=1.1.0 VERSION_BOOTLOADER=1.2.0
```

Variables `VERSION_FIRMWARE` and `VERSION_BOOTLOADER` are optional and default to the contents of `tiny-firmware/VERSION` and `tiny-firmware/bootloader/VERSION` respectively.
